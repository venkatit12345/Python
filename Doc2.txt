Python Keywords are special reserved words which convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter. Each keyword have a special meaning and a specific operation. These keywords can't be used as variable. Following is the List of Python Keywords.

True	False	None	and	as
asset	def	class	continue	break
else	finally	elif	del	except
global	for	if	from	import
raise	try	or	return	pass
nonlocal	in	not	is	lambda

Python Literals

Literals can be defined as a data that is given in a variable or constant.

Python support the following literals:

I. String literals:

String literals can be formed by enclosing a text in the quotes. We can use both single as well as double quotes for a String.

Eg:

"Aman" , '12345'

Types of Strings:

There are two types of Strings supported in Python:

a).Single line String- Strings that are terminated within a single line are known as Single line Strings.

Eg:

>>> text1='hello'  
b).Multi line String- A piece of text that is spread along multiple lines is known as Multiple line String.

There are two ways to create Multiline Strings:

1). Adding black slash at the end of each line.

Eg:

>>> text1='hello\  
user'  
>>> text1  
'hellouser'  
>>>  
2).Using triple quotation marks:-

Eg:

>>> str2='''''welcome 
to 
SSSIT'''  
>>> print str2  
welcome  
to  
SSSIT  

II.Numeric literals:

Numeric Literals are immutable. Numeric literals can belong to following four different numerical types.

Int(signed integers)	Long(long integers)	float(floating point)	Complex(complex)
Numbers( can be both positive and negative) with no fractional part.eg: 100	Integers of unlimited size followed by lowercase or uppercase L eg: 87032845L	Real numbers with both integer and fractional part eg: -26.2	In the form of a+bj where a forms the real part and b forms the imaginary part of complex number. eg: 3.14j

>>> val1=10  
>>> val2=None  
>>> val1  
10  
>>> val2  
>>> print val2  
None  

Python Operators

The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in a particular programming language. Python provides a variety of operators described as follows.

Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%)
Comparison operators(<,>,<=,>=)
Assignment Operators
Logical Operators(&,|,!,!=)
Bitwise Operators
Membership Operators(in,not in)
Identity Operators( is ,is not)

Comments in Python

# This is single line comment.  
print "Hello Python" 

Multi Line Comment:

Multi lined comment can be given inside triple quotes.

eg:

''''' This 
    Is 
    Multipline comment'''
